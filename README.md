# project1

1.) What the project does

    The project creates another tool for Chicago residents, or those interested in moving to Chicago, to use when searching for safe neighborhoods to move to. Users can check crime information by location in for the city of Chicago to get a better understanding of what neighbothoods might be safer than others. 

2.) List of API's 

    City of Chicago API
    Google Maps API

3.) Challenges we experienced

    One of the biggest challenges we faced during the project was finding an API that had all the relevant data. We hit a road block late in the development of the site and had to scrap the original API we were using for crime data. Once we found a crime API that contained crime information as well as latitude longitude data, another challenge was running those coordinates through the google maps API and displaying it on the page. 

4.) Where next


    Given more time, we would like to create a feed back system for out users. It would be helpful to store and display their experiences in terms of safety that they have had in each of the neighborhoods. Perhaps a rating/comment section for each ward. 
        Additionally we would like to make the search query more comprehensive. There are tons of information we can pull and check crime with, but due to time constraints and having to switch API's we were unable to achieve this.
